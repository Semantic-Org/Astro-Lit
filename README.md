> First party support for Lit was included up until Astro 5 but was removed. This community version preserves Lit SSR rendering for newer versions of Lit.

This **[Astro integration](https://astro.build/integrations/)** enables server-side rendering and client-side hydration for your [Lit](https://lit.dev/) custom elements.
